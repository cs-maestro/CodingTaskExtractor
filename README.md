# CodingTaskExtractor
Coding Task Extractor is a Java application that extracts TODO and FIXME tasks from source code files. It analyzes the specified files, identifies code comments containing TODO or FIXME keywords, and extracts the associated task descriptions. The extracted tasks are then written to a text file.
